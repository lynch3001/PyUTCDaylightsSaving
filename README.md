# PyUTCDaylightsSaving

This is just a silly little challenge someone whipped up, and I hopefully completed. Just posting here so all files stay in tack. 

test.py is the main file. 
It runs on the assumption that you have pytz installed via pip.

Dont worry if you dont or not sure how to, You can still run this if you are on a windows based machine, by going into the test directory, and running test.exe
